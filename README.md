# Code_Encryption_Decryption_Generator
A Python project that generates executable code from input text and applies encryption algorithms to ensure data security. Includes features for encoding, decoding, and secure transmission.
# Text-to-Code Generator with Encryption (Python)

## 📌 Description
This project converts plain text into encoded code format and secures it using encryption algorithms.  
It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate:
- Text-to-code conversion logic
- Data encryption and decryption
- Secure data handling in Python

## 🚀 Features
